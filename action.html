                <p>When it comes to protecting yourself from phishing attacks, it’s always important to make sure that your spam filters are operational in order to keep out a large amount of attacks. There are, however, some attacks that can make it through spam filters, or to which spam filters are not applicable. In these cases, it is important to take additional cautionary measures. These can include, but are not limited to:

                <p>If you receive a suspicious call, text, or email that you think may be a phishing scam, there are certain steps you can take to report the scam and ensure personal safety.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you recognize the person or company that seemingly sent the email, contact them through some other reliable means to ensure that they haven’t been hacked.</li>
                    <li>According to the FTC, If you have reason to believe that an attacker has your information, visit Identitytheft.gov, where you can follow certain steps depending on what you believe was stolen.</li>

                <p>Once you are sure that your computer and your data are secure, report the phishing scam through one of the following FTC-approved means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phishing emails should be forwarded to the Anti-Phishing Working Group at reportphishing@apwg.org</li>
